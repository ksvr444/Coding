Digital currencies:
-> currency available in digital form, virtual currency
-> instantaneous transaction
-> avoids risk of losing money during transport
-> Litecoin
-> Etherium
-> Digital currencies use blockchain technology. A blockchain is simply a decentralised 	database that all users share. There is no central server and nobody owns the data but 	everyone in the blockchain has access to all the data in the blockchain.
->Users earn or create blocks (units) in a digital currency by solving complex 	cryptographic puzzles and verifying transactions, also known as mining. This is a 	difficult process that requires significant computing power. Blocks are then added to a 	blockchain where they can be used for electronic peer-to-peer payments. The blockchain 	tracks ownership of each currency unit and holds a history of every transaction ever 			made on the blockchain.
-> Reduced Transaction costs
-> High security


Internet of Things
-> The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
-> IoT has evolved from the convergence of wireless technologies, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microservices and the internet
-> IoT evolved from machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, i.e., machines connecting to each other via a network without human interaction. M2M refers to connecting a device to the cloud, managing it and collecting data.
-> Taking M2M to the next level, IoT is a sensor network of billions of smart devices that connect people, systems and other applications to collect and share data. As its foundation, M2M offers the connectivity that enables IoT.
-> The internet of things helps people live and work smarter as well as gain complete control over their lives. 
-> As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.
-> If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted.


Block chain:
-> Blockchain can be defined as a chain of the block that contains information.
-> The blockchain is used for the secure transfer of items like money, property, contracts, etc. without requiring a third-party intermediary like bank or government. Once a data is recorded inside a blockchain, it is very difficult to change it. 


Artificial Intelligence:
-> providing intelligence to the machines, computer systems.
-> includes learing(gaining knowledge), reasoning(getting conclusions), self correction
-> subsets of AI: Machine learning, Big data, Natural language processing
-> Artificial narrow intelligence: perform single tasks smartly. Voice assistent.
-> Artificial general intelligence: its intelligence can be applied for various tasks,learn and improves itself than ANI. alphaGo.
-> Artificial super intellligence: more powerful and sohisticated than human intelligence.Thinks about abstractions which are impossible to think about humans.


Machine Learning:
-> scientific study of algorithms and statistical models to perform a specific task.
-> 80% input is given to algorithm for the logic == training
-> 20% input is given to logic for the desired output == testing
-> supervised learning: labelled data, under supervisor, classification, regression.
-> unsupervised learning: unlabelled data, no need of supervisor, association, clustering.


Natural language processing:
-> transforming structured data into natural language.
-> syntactic and semantic analysis are the techniques used for NLP.
-> syntactic analysis assess language based on gramatical rules, parsing, segmentation
-> semantic analysis involves use and meaning behind words, heplps in forming structures


Big data:
-> dealing huge amounts of data
-> structured-organized data(rows and cols, rdbms), unstructured-not organized(emails, multimedia data), semi structured-structured data not obeying formal structure(csv, xml, json)
-> hadoop is collection of software utilities involves solving complex problems dealing with large amounts of data.
-> hadoop distributed file system is a primary data storage for hadoop applications.high performance access to data.
-> tools-hive, pig, sqoop
-> hive is DWH infrastructure tool to process structured data in hadoop(SQL engine)
-> pig tool process all kinds of data
-> sqoop exports and imports filesto hadoop to relational databases


Face Recognition:
-> identifying and verifying a person from a digital image.
-> eigen faces, local binary pattern histogram, fisher faces, scale invariant feature transform, speed up robust features
