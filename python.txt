1. Python is neither a pure compiled or pure interpreted language but it is called as interpreted language.
2. Python is dynamically typed, this means that you donâ€™t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that.
3. Python is well suited to object orientated programming but it is not completely object-oriented as it contains some procedural functions.
4. Procedural --> the entire code is written into one long procedure. It is not manageable as both data and logic get mixed together.
5. Object Oriented --> the program is split into self-contained objects or several mini-programs. 
   Each object is representing a different part of the application which has its own data and logic to communicate among themselves.
6. Lists are mutable, Tuples are immutable
7. Accessing elements from Lists is slower where as faster in Tuples.
8. Compiled languages has its code translation before hand imean before runtime. 
9. Interpreted --> The complete code is not in machine level before runtime. 
   Translation of code occurs at the time of execution.
10. PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. 
    It is set of rules that specify the format of the code.
11. Classes contain data members, but they can also contain functions as members.
    Namespace is simply an abstract way of grouping items together.
    It checks whether the names are unique to avoid naming conflicts.
